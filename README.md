## üìÅ Libraries Used

Make sure the following `.jar` files are included in your `/WEB-INF/lib/` directory:

- `json-20230227.jar`
- `pdfbox-app-3.0.5.jar`

These are required for JSON parsing and PDF manipulation respectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
cd YourRepoName
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Your Servlet Environment

Open the project in **Eclipse**.

Ensure **Apache Tomcat 11.0.7** is configured as the server.

Place the `.jar` files (`json-20230227.jar` and `pdfbox-app-3.0.5.jar`) in:

```bash
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Update Upload Path

In `FileUploadServlet.java`, set the `uploadPath` variable to the folder where uploaded files should be stored:

```java
String uploadPath = "/absolute/path/to/your/upload/folder";
```

Make sure this path exists and is **writable** by the Tomcat process.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

Start the **Apache Tomcat** server.

Access the app at:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/FileUploader/upload.html
```
